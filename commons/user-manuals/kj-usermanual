## How I get my best work done:

I love structure and organization! I'm happiest when the whole team is following a set of conventions and everyone's on board. I get frustrated if people go off on their own for extended periods because I feel a bit lost in the process. I much prefer over-communication to under. 

That all said, I am a big fan of Github's kanban since it helps everyone see what everyone else is working on! Please assign yourself the issues that you are taking on, use the appropriate labels and drag your issues into the correct kanban column. 

Feel free to ping me messages anytime! I'm totally down to do whatever I can to help out. I know it can to hard to follow so many different communication platforms, but I really value when people check their messages and respond back to messages that I've sent.

## The role I usually take in a team:

Building on what I said about organization, I really try my best to anticipate team communication issues. As best as I can, I try to keep us all on the same page - through stand-ups / retrospectives / calendars / kanban etc.

I am flexible in the role I take in a team and happy to fill in gaps where I see them. My strengths are in design / user experience / user interface. My favourite framework is React! I am really keen to learn more about accessible design and also get better at testing and code coverage. My weakness is in continuous integration and deployment. ðŸ˜±

## My communication style: 
![talking gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/g0pZS4PbuQO60Jfmc9/giphy.gif)
I try to be blunt without hurting feelings. Sometimes I can be short, especially when under pressure. If I am being insensitive, please let me know! I don't think that my opinions are better than anyone else's and the last thing I want to do is make someone feel uncomfortable.

If I am asking a question, it is because I honestly don't really know the answer. 

If I go silent - check in on me! It's possible that I've checked out.

## What I value: 
![Break gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/5Ff4rP8zrUNSo/giphy.gif)
Patience, inclusion, jokes, clear communication and an empathetic work environment. 
Oh - and lots of breaks!

## What people misunderstand about me:

I worry about sounding patronizing and may leave out information because of that. Let me know if I am breezing through something too fast and it will also help me understand how to explain myself more clearly and also help me feel comfortable in asking you questions in the future. 

When I am tired I have the tendency to lose my words - just let me know if I need to take a breath and re-explain something.

## How I like to get my feedback:  
Straight away and blunt. Don't worry about hurting my feelings!

Can't wait to work with you!!!!
