## How do I edit my user manual?

Your manuals are all in this repo as issues. Click on the 'issues' tab above to see them all.
Find your own, and click the `...` in the top right of the comment to edit it and add your info.
We will make time regularly to go back and edit this info, so don't worry if you can't think of incredibly insightful things to write at first, but do try to fill in as much as you can.

## Why are we doing this?

It's a great way to think about ourselves and how we work in a team. It's also a great way to find out about our team-mates before working together so we know how to get the best out of each other and work well as a team ðŸ‘­ðŸ‘¬
