# Summary

Local communities and networks of interest need better ways to choose and use tools for communication and collaboration, and also to use these to animate maps of local assets and connections. Founders and Coders (https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) and Outlandish (https://outlandish.com/) will work with Networked City (https://networkedcity.london/Start) (NWC) on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to demonstrate how better tool choices might be made, and how further development work might enable tools integration.

We can use current NWC work with local communities and networks of interest to test and evolve the MVP. We'll also explore how to build on workshop games that have addressed these issues, and use the MVP to enhance games and undertake further user testing. This would provide a basis for a funding bid for further product development.

## The  problem

In order to support online communication and collaboration people need to choose and learn tools at different levels:

* Personal tools - e.g. email, text, blog, social media
* Group tools - as above plus e.g. newsletter, website, document editing, video conferencing, collaboration space
* Community and network tools - as above plus others like shared calendars

There is a bewildering choice of tools, and people end up in lots of different online places that may not easily connect. This is particularly challenging for anyone attempting to create some common ground for a local community, or a network. 

People may be unwilling to join a new system, or a particular commercial platform like Facebook. Sharing content from one place to another requires facilitation, agreement on what is sharable or not, and connecting tools.

## Some solutions

We and others have different parts of the the solution:

* Here's how Network thinking and mapping (https://networkedcity.london/networks/index) can help us understand the assets and needs of communities and networks. That describes and visualises the ecosystem, and allows us to monitor and facilitate development.
* Here's a matrix of tools that might be used in a locality or network - https://quip.com/uj9kA3k1dnJD
* Here's why we need to be able to learn and work across project groups, communities of interest and wider social networks, by Harold Jarche - the network learning model (http://jarche.com/2016/03/unified-models-for-work-and-learning/).
